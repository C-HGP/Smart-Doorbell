This is a doorbell with smart functions.
It does sound, like a regular doorbell when you press the button, but it also starts a livestream and sends a message via webhook on slack.

We made this as a project for our embedded class.

# Setup #
Both the folders will have individual instructions for both units.
It is **important** that you plug in the button with cam first, or the speaker will fail to find the MQTT server. 

# Components # 
* RasPi Zero x2
* Button
* Speaker PHAT w attached external speaker
* Casing ( Stripped regular doorbell ) 
* RasPi electrical adapters 

***TODO***
- [ ] Computer Vision

***Known Issues***
- [ ] Fix webhook sending more than 1 slack message.

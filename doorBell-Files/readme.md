# doorBell w CAM

# Setup #
To set this up, you'll need to get both the **bell.py** and the **mjpg-streamer**.
We used their streaming code and edited the HTML to get rid of the unnecessary buttons and menus and only show the user the livestream.
You'll also need to get **bell.py** to autorun, we edited bash.rc.

You will also need to install mosquitto to get MQTT working, Google can help you with this!
